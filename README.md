# ClimateChangeGame

Made with the GlowScript, this game is called Climate Change: A Reality. The user is a human, placed in the middle of the screen. Using the up, down, left and right arrow keys, the human is tasked with navigating through trees, snowballs and lava blocks to catch the three-eyed aliens. But beware, strange physics are involved in this game so it may be harder to play than you might think!

Here is the link to the playable game:
